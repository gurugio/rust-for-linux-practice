TODO:
* run the unittest of CStr with `make LLVM=1 rusttest`

## 28

continue review: https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/pull/526
* continue to read https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/locking/seqlock.rst
* sequence counter and seq-lock are different
* seq-lock = sequence counter + write-side serialization + write-side non-preemption
* I cannot review that PR at the moment because I am not good enought at RUST.

* CStr structure implements to_str method
* CStr? a string terminated by NULL-byte, inter-operation with kernel functions taking C string
* self.0 is an array of u8
* to_str() only calls core::str::from_utf8(&self.0[..self.len()]) (array of u8 without the last NULL-byte)
* What is core library? -> TODO
* How can I run the unittest in rust/kernel/str.rs?
